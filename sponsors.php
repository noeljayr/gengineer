            Our STEM Sponsorship program seeks to remove financial barriers that

            textbooks, educational materials, and other critical resources. By
            enabling girls from disadvantaged backgrounds to pursue STEM
            education, you help them unlock their potential, creating a brighter
            future for themselves and their communities.
